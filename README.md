Consumer Complaint Text Classification


## 1. Explanatory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering

In this initial phase of the project, we delve into the Consumer Complaint Dataset to gain insights into the data and engineer relevant features for text classification. This step involves the following key activities:

- **Data Exploration**: We thoroughly explore the dataset to understand its structure, size, and characteristics. This includes examining the distribution of consumer complaints across categories and identifying potential patterns.

- **Feature Extraction**: We extract informative features from the complaint data that can aid in classifying the complaints accurately. This may include considering metadata, such as timestamps or complaint IDs, in addition to the textual content.

- **Data Visualization**: We use data visualization techniques to create meaningful plots, charts, and graphs to visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies within the dataset. These visualizations help in understanding the data and identifying any outliers or data quality issues.

- **Feature Engineering**: We engineer features from the text data to make it suitable for machine learning models. This may involve techniques like tokenization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

The insights gained and features engineered in this step serve as the foundation for subsequent stages of the project, including text pre-processing and model development.

## 2. Text Pre-Processing

In this phase, we focus on preparing the text data for effective model training and classification. Text pre-processing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and it involves the following key tasks:

- **Text Tokenization**: We break down the text data into individual words or tokens. This step is essential for understanding the structure of the text and processing it effectively.

- **Stopword Removal**: Stopwords are common words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") that do not carry significant meaning and can be safely removed to reduce noise in the data.

- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: We apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form. This helps in standardizing variations of words and improving text similarity.

The pre-processed text data is then ready for feature extraction and model training.

For detailed text pre-processing code and techniques, please refer to the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/text_preprocessing.ipynb`.

## 3. Selection of Multi Classification Model

For text classification, we have chosen the **Logistic Regression** model. Logistic Regression is a popular choice for binary and multi-class classification tasks, and it works well for text data. In this step, we train a Logistic Regression model using the pre-processed text data to classify consumer complaints into the predefined categories.

For the implementation of the Logistic Regression model, please refer to the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/model_selection.ipynb`.

## 4. Comparison of Model Performance

We understand the importance of selecting the right model for the task. In this phase, we compare the performance of the Logistic Regression model with other potential models. The goal is to determine which model provides the highest classification accuracy and generalization to unseen data.

To view the results of the model performance comparison, please refer to the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/model_comparison.ipynb`.

## 5. Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is a critical step to assess the effectiveness of the chosen Logistic Regression model. We use various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's performance. Additionally, we generate visualizations like confusion matrices to gain insights into how the model classifies complaints.

The results of the model evaluation are detailed in the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb`.

## 6. Prediction

Once the Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated, it is ready for making predictions on new, unseen consumer complaints. This step enables us to automatically categorize incoming complaints into the predefined categories, facilitating efficient customer support and decision-making.

For making predictions using the trained Logistic Regression model, please refer to the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/prediction.ipynb`.
